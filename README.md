# 📝 Learning Log

**Learning Log** is a web application built with Python and Django, styled using [django-bootstrap5](https://pypi.org/project/django-bootstrap5/). It allows users to track topics they're learning about and make entries recording what they've learned.

This project was developed by following the *Python Crash Course* book by Eric Matthes as a hands-on exercise in learning Django web development.
